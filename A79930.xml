            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>leſt <hi>beſides the intent</hi> of both Houſes of <hi>Parliament,</hi> it become a ſnare and vexation to very many of the beſt affected in the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>The chief Paſſages to be confidered in the <hi>Ordinance,</hi> are the <hi>perſons to whom preaching is forbidden,</hi> and the true ſenſe of the word <hi>Preach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, Perſons <hi>not ordain'd</hi> may be diſtinguiſhed, for they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:158479:4"/>are either ſuch as never were at any <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity,</hi> or Schooles of Learning, nor have attain'd unto a competent meaſure of learning by any other means; ſuch as never intend the Miniſtry, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver called thereunto by any company of people that are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have a power to call them, ſuch as are ingaged in their Trades, Artificiall crafts, or other civill imployments and courſe of life, theſe doubtleſſe are the perſons which moſt <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>intentionally</hi> are <hi>forbidden to preach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or ſecondly, there are other perſons not yet <hi>ordain'd,</hi> which have been educated in the Schooles of Learning, have received degrees in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi> have preached for ſeverall yeeres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, are every way gifted with parts, both naturall and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that may fit them for the Miniſtry, which likewiſe they really intend, and give up themſelves unto; but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding have not been ordained, partly, becauſe never call'd to office (ordination, as they conceive, being proper to no other but ſuch as are ſo call'd) and partly, becauſe formerly they ſcrupled ordination by Biſhops, and ſince the reigne of Biſhops, till now lately, no perſons have been appointed to adminiſter ordination to thoſe that ſhould deſire it. And laſtly, do ſtill ſcruple the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent form of ordination, which is acknowledged on all ſides to be extraordinary, and <hi>beſide the rule,</hi> and but <hi>for the preſent exigencie,</hi> for which among other weighty reaſons (as they apprehend) they judge it better to forbeare, till Church-matters be fully ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Kingdome. Now, though the firſt ſort not ordain'd, or not intending the Miniſtry, are forbidden to preach, yet how far the <hi>Parliament</hi> intends that ſuch as theſe laſt ſhould be ſilenced from preaching, muſt be left to wiſe men rationally to judge.</p>
            <p>Only thus much may be ſaid, that there are no leſſe then many hundreds of this latter ſort, very able and orthodox, ſome living as Chaplaines, and Students in private families; others, at this time, preaching many eminent Lectures in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, with much bleſſing upon their labours; beſides the many Schoole-maſters, and Fellowes of Colledges, which by this means will be laid aſide as uſeleſſe, from their profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table courſe of preaching, if no difference be put betwixt them and the firſt ſort of perſons <hi>not ordain'd;</hi> and how prejudiciall this may be to the <hi>Reformation intended,</hi> eſpecially in ſuch a time as this is, when there is ſo great a ſcarcity of able preaching
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:158479:4"/>Miniſters, and ſo little hope of ſupply from the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at home or abroad, and hereby what diſcontents it may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the minds of the well affected, how much prophaneneſſe among others (at leaſt) in the remoter parts of the Kingdome, ſince it will neceſſarily follow, that many Congregations will be depriv'd of that faithfull and painfull preaching they were wont to injoy. And laſtly, how many ingenuous and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men, who are of known ability and honeſty, but yet cannot for the reaſons above mentioned, ſubmit to the preſent ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be left under an impoſſibility of ſubſiſting, and groan under ſuch diſcour agements as are very unſuitable to a time of
<hi>Reformation,</hi> is likeweſe left to all wiſe men to conſider of.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the perſons in the Ordinance forbidden to preach.</p>
            <p>Next, let us expend the word <hi>Preach,</hi> which in the common and vulgar acception, <hi>is the naming of a verſe or two of Scripture for a Text, and ſpending of an hour or more upon it, by opening of the words, dividing them into parts, raiſing Doctrines, framing Reaſons, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes in the ſame form and manner, as is ordinarily uſed in Pulpits; this properly ſeemes to be that which is forbidden to perſons not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd in ſome reformed Church, and not intending the Miniſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet it followes not, that firſt, perſons not ordain'd in any reformed Church, or not intending the Miniſtery, may not reade the Scriptures, and expound them as well as they are able for the benefit of them that belong unto their charge: as ſuppoſe a Maſter to his Family, a Captain to his Company, a Collonel to his Regiment, a Generall to his Army, a King to his People, if he hath the grace to do it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it followes not that ſuch perſons, or any other of Gods people are hereby forbidden upon any juſt occaſion to meet together for prayer or mutuall edification, in way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference or conſulting the holy Scriptures, whether it be for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, inſtruction and counſell, or for brotherly admonition and reproof, or any other Chriſtian duty in what kind ſoever, <hi>provided that they do it at ſuch ſeaſons as hinders not the publique preaching, and in ſuch a manner as diſturbs not the publike peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the hindrance of the duties contain'd under theſe two laſt heads, cannot poſſibly be meant by the forbidding of perſons <hi>not ordain'd, or not intending the Miniſtry, to preach,</hi> not only appeares
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:158479:5"/>from the plain and grammaticall conſtruction of the Ordinance, but alſo from the incongruity of fixing ſo ill a ſenſe with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of a Reformation which both Houſes of Parliament have declared; and indeed, how can it rationally be imagined from any expreſſion in the Ordinance, that any ſuch thing ſhould be aim'd at by them? Is it not the blackeſt, the fouleſt aſperſion that can be caſt into the face of our Reforming Parliament? eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the conſiderations following being well weighed?</p>
            <p>For firſt, to forbid men the uſe and improvement of their Talents, every one in his proper ſphear, according to rule and order, is it not a direct contradiction of pregnant and apparent Scriptures? both teſtimonies and examples are not wanting; did not <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
<hi>Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>Gideon,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> with many others in the ſacred ſtory, not only incourage, but <hi>exhort</hi> their ſouldiers, and that in thoſe words and expreſſions, which are now become no leſſe then parts of thoſe very Scriptures which in all things are the moſt adequate and compleat rule both of faith and practice? <hi>Exod.</hi>

            <p>Now ſuch known duties as theſe, having been ſo commonly and conſtantly received and practiſed (and that in all ages) throughout all Reformed Churches, yea, and ſo abundantly
<hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd in Scripture,</hi> ſhall any man dare to think that the Parliament in this, or any other Ordinance, would goe about in the leaſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:158479:5"/>meaſure to diſcourage, much leſſe oppoſe them? 'Tis malignity and diſaffection towards that moſt great and honourable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Kingdom, by miſ-interpreting of their actions, to ſeek an occaſion of entertaining ſo dangerous and bad a thought of them. No, no, the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which intends, and laboure for a <hi>Reformation according to the Word of God,</hi> and which every day fits under ſuch powerfull and heavenly Doctrine from the eminent Preachers of it, cannot rationally be ſuppos'd not to abhorre and abominate the contrivement of ſo great an evill.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as the above mentioned miſ-interpretation of the <hi>Ordinance,</hi> would be a direct contradiction to apparent Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; ſo likewiſe to many <hi>Votes, Orders, Ordinances, Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> formerly paſſed through both Houſes, yea, and moſt of all to the <hi>Solemne League</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> between the Kingdomes, wherein every one

               </p>
               <p>And becauſe theſe kingdoms are guilty of many ſins and provocations againſt GOD, and his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, as is too manifeſt by our preſent diſtreſſes and dangers, the fruits thereof; we profeſſe and declare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and the world, our <hi>unfained</hi> deſire to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for our own ſins, and for the ſins of theſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes;
<hi>eſpecially</hi> that we have not, as we ought, <hi>valued</hi> the <hi>ineſtimable</hi> benefit of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that wee have not laboured for the purity and power thereof, and that we have not endevoured to <hi>receive Chriſt</hi> in our <hi>hearts,</hi> nor to walk worthy of him in our <hi>lives,</hi> which are the cauſes of other ſins and tranſgreſſions, ſo much abounding amongſt us; And our <hi>true</hi> and <hi>unfained</hi> purpoſe, deſire and indeavour for our ſelves, and all others under our power and charge, both in publike and in private, in all duties we owe to God and man, to amend our lives, and <hi>each one</hi> to go
<hi>before another,</hi> in the <hi>example</hi> of a <hi>reall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> that the Lord may turn away his wrath and heavie indignation, and eſtabliſh theſe Churches and Kingdomes in truth and peace. And this <hi>Covenant</hi> we make in the <hi>preſence</hi> of <hi>Almighty God,</hi> the ſearcher of all hearts, with a <hi>true intention</hi> to <hi>perform</hi> the ſame, <hi>as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:158479:7"/>we ſhall anſwer</hi> at that great day, when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be diſcloſed; moſt humbly beſeeching the Lord, to ſtrengthen us by his holy Spirit for this end, and to bleſs our deſires and proceedings with ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, as may be <hi>deliverance</hi> and <hi>ſafety</hi> to his <hi>people,</hi> and encouragement to other Chriſtian Churches groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under, or in danger of the yoke of Antichriſtian Tyranny—</p>
               <p>Now wherein doth the <hi>power</hi> of godlineſſe here aſſerted, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted for,</hi> and <hi>owned</hi> to <hi>be maintain'd</hi> by <hi>Solemne League</hi> and
<hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> more properly (at leaſt in the externall part of it) conſiſt, then in the diligent improvement of gifts and graces by the holy practices of the aforeſaid duties? Can the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> (think we) thus ingaged, thus unanimouſly appearing for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the power of godlineſſe, before the world (for which end the <hi>Solemn League</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> was turned into <hi>Latine,</hi> and Cent to all the Proteſtant Churches) be rationally ſuppoſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any ſuch miſchievous ſenſe in the <hi>Ordinance</hi> as hath been mentioned?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſhould the giving an advantage to perſecuting ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, be any way at all aimed at in this <hi>Ordinance,</hi> which is the generall <hi>(though injurious)</hi> apprehenſion of ill minded men, would not this be an an <hi>eſtabliſhing of Tyr anny</hi> by a <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for <hi>oppreſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n?</hi> a <hi>juſtifying</hi> of what is already more then once condemned by this <hi>preſent Parliament?</hi> Were not the Courts of <hi>Star-chamber</hi> and <hi>High Commiſſion</hi> therefore <hi>aboliſhed</hi> by an <hi>Act,</hi> becauſe the <hi>juſt Liberty</hi> of the Subject, not only in his eſtate and perſon, but alſo in the
<hi>tenderneſſe</hi> of his <hi>conſcience,</hi> and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of his practice, in wayes of godlineſſe, was ſo much ſtruck at by them? And can it be now rationally imagined, that the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who with the reſt of the Kingdome in thoſe
<hi>Star-chamber</hi> and <hi>high Commiſſion</hi> dayes, ſo <hi>ſorely ſmarted</hi> under Prelaticall pride and power, ſhould now voluntarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave the whole body of the nation by whom they are truſted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bondage and miſery, far worſe then the former, becauſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by that very Authority which ſhould ſuppreſſe it? Are not the eyes of the whole kingdome ſet upon this preſent <hi>Parliament</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:158479:7"/>in expectation of deliverance rather, from ſuch like and all other grievances?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, were there any the leaſt ground (as indeed there is none at all) to believe ſuch a deſtructive ſcope from any one ſyllable in the <hi>Ordinance,</hi> would it not ſoon beget a jealouſie of a very <hi>dangerous plot</hi> indeed for the <hi>breaking</hi> our <hi>new moulded army,</hi> by weakening the hearts and hands of all the <hi>faithfull</hi> and valiant both
<hi>Commanders</hi> and <hi>Souldiers,</hi> who ſtand ready girt with the utmoſt hazard of their lives to <hi>ſave</hi> the three kingdomes?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, ſhould the proſecution of this <hi>Ordinance</hi> be according to the aforeſaid malignant ſenſe and latitude, would not all the great <hi>powers</hi> of the kingdome (to whom it is recommended) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come no better then <hi>executioners</hi> to torment the <hi>precious of the land?</hi> and that for doing no other then thoſe moſt known duties, the neglect whereof, either for feare or favour of any mortalls whatſoever, would neceſſarily render them obnoxious to the danger of <hi>eternall wrath</hi> in hell fire?</p>
               <p>Sixtly, by this means, would not the hands of the rude mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude (which needs no ſtirring up) be ſtrengthened, and the violence of the ſpoiler, againſt the inſolent, be increaſed without controul? Would not faſting and prayer, godly conference, and all religious exerciſes, quickly be even hooted at, and baniſhed out of every town and family throughout the kingdome? Can it be imagined with any ſenſe or ſhadow of reaſon, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould conſent to this? God forbid, that any man ſhould ever finde place for ſuch a feare.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, How ill a requitall would this be for all the <hi>loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and love, which the godly party in this kingdome have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in the loſſe of their eſtates, and of many of their lives and blood? and which the <hi>ſuperviving remnant</hi> are ſtill willing to hazard, with as much cheerſulneſſe, as any other whatſoever, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have done, or ever ſhall do?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if after ſo many yeers indefatigable labours and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſultations, ſeconded with innumerable prayers and teares, if after ſo many brave hopes of a Reformation
<hi>pleaded, contended, fought</hi> for, <hi>the iſſue of all</hi> ſhould be a <hi>leaving of the godly party</hi> to a neceſſity of <hi>flying</hi> from <hi>perſecution, countenanced</hi> and <hi>rais'd</hi> againſt them in their <hi>own native Countrey,</hi> and this by that very <hi>Parliament</hi> which hath been <hi>preſerved</hi> by them; by that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:158479:8"/>
                  <hi>Parliament,</hi> which hath found them both prevalent and powerfull helpers in the hour of their diſtreſſe, as well by their prayers at home, as their ſucceſſe abroad; would not this be a guilt of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large extent, even ſpreading over the whole nation in their <hi>repreſentative</hi> body of it? Would it not be a crime, reaching up to heaven; and fetching down all manner of plagues, curſes, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon whatſoever <hi>counſells</hi> or <hi>undertakings</hi> both of Church and State? But bleſſed be God, who yet hath left us one moſt <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant and ſatisfying argument</hi> to evince, that our <hi>renowned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Parliament</hi> hath no intentions either in this or any other <hi>Ordinance</hi> to grieve the faithfull, and thereby incurre the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of that God, who hitherto hath been intreated to continue a ſhield and buckler to our diſtreſſed <hi>England.</hi> And to put the queſtion out of all doubt, be it known to thee (<hi>Reader,</hi> whoſoever thou art) <hi>That in the day when this</hi> Ordinance <hi>paſſed in the Houſe of Commons, it was then and there declared by the ſaid Houſe, that they intended not hereby to diſcountenance, much leſſe forbid any man to reade Scriptures, and expound them in his Family, or any under his charge, which they conceived to be every mans duty in the place God hath ſet him.</hi> It had been well indeed if this <hi>Declaration</hi> had been printed with the <hi>Ordinance;</hi> but ſince it is not printed, what remains, but that every man notwithſtanding, ſhould go on in the practice of every Chriſtian duty, both in his Family, and (as juſt occaſion ſerves) amongſt his honeſt neighbours, being alwayes prepar'd for the Edification of himſelf and others?</p>
               <p>You therefore Gentlemen of the Souldiery in the field, though <hi>(not intending the Miniſtery)</hi> for reaſons beſt known unto the State, you are forbidden to preach, as that which in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belongs not to you; yet doubtleſſe, you may both <hi>pray and ſpeak too</hi> in the head of your Companies, Regiments and Armies, you may deliver the piety of your ſouls the wel-grounded confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of your hearts, the valour of your minds, <hi>in ſuch Orations, in ſuch Liberties of ſpeech,</hi> as may beſt enſpirit the men that follow you, with ſuch a religious and undaunted animation as may render them unconquerable before the proudeſt enemy: And to juſtifie you in ſo doing, beſide the examples already mentioned from Scripture, and of many other Chriſtian Kings and Generals which might be reckoned up (to inſtance one for all, <hi>the late fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous King of</hi> Sweden) the ancient cuſtome of the

               </p>
               <p>And you the reſt of Gods people, of whatſoever rank and condition, in whatſoever
